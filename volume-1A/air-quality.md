## 9. Air Quality

### 9.1 Introduction

This chapter describes the methodology used to assess the impacts of the M4 East project (the project) on regional, local and in-tunnel air quality, and the results of that assessment in summary. Appendix H provides greater detail of the monitoring and modelling methodologies and results.

The Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DP&E) has issued a set of environmental assessment requirements for the project; these are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 9.1 sets out these requirements, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).

### 9.2 Assessment approach

#### 9.2.1 Overview

This assessment considers the impacts of the project on regional and local air quality, and the cumulative impacts of this project and the M4-M5 link. The assessment also includes detailed analysis of the predicted quality of air inside the tunnel.

A number of recent air quality assessments for surface roads and tunnels in Australia and New Zealand were reviewed to identify methodologies, tools and findings that could inform the project assessment. These previous assessments are summarised in Appendix D of the air quality assessment report in Appendix H.  The summary includes details of the pollutants considered, the sources of emissions, the dispersion models used, and the approaches used to assess impacts on air quality during construction and operation.

#### 9.2.2 Terminology

The concentration of a pollutant at a given location comprises contributions from various sources. Several terms have been used to describe these contributions.

The following terms have been used in this chapter to describe the concentration of a pollutant at a specific location (receptor) over a specific averaging period:

* **Background concentration** describes all contributing sources of a pollutant concentration other than road traffic. It includes, for example, contributions from natural sources, industry and domestic activity
* **Surface road concentration** describes the contribution of pollutants from the surface road network. It includes not only the contribution of the nearest road at the receptor, but also the net contribution of the modelled road network at the receptor
* **Ventilation outlet concentration** describes the contribution of pollutants from tunnel ventilation outlets
* **Total concentration** is the sum of the sources defined above: background, surface road and ventilation outlet concentrations. It may relate to conditions with or without the project under assessment
* **The change in concentration due to the project** is the difference between the total concentration with the project and the total concentration without the project, and may be either an increase or a decrease, depending on factors including the redistribution of traffic on the network as a result of the project.

#### 9.2.3 Air quality criteria

Air quality was assessed in relation to the criteria listed in Table 9.2.

##### In-tunnel air quality

###### Carbon monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) has historically been an indicator of the level of motor vehicle emissions in tunnels, and has therefore been used as the basis of in-tunnel air quality criteria. Advances in vehicle technology have been effective in reducing the levels of CO emissions, so that other emissions are now more relevant indicators of in-tunnel air quality. Chief among these is nitrogen dioxide.

###### Nitrogen dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a respiratory irritant with identified health effects at levels that may be encountered in road tunnels (section 10.4.1). DP&E considers that NO2 is the key pollutant of concern for in-tunnel air quality, and applied new criteria to the NorthConnex tunnel in its approval conditions (NSW Department of Planning and Environment 2015). The new criterion for NO2 is a tunnel average of 0.5 parts per million (ppm), measured as a rolling average throughout the tunnel, with a limit at any point in the tunnel of 1.0 ppm. This criterion is equivalent to the most stringent international workplace health and safety criteria and compares favourably to international design guidelines for in-tunnel NO2 levels, which range between 0.4 ppm and 1.0 ppm. Detailed design of the project tunnel would address this criterion under all operating conditions, in addition to the CO and visibility (particulate) limits noted in Table 9.3 and Table 9.4. These are the same operational criteria applied to the recently approved NorthConnex tunnel.

###### Visibility and particulate matter

Visibility is an important consideration in the design of the tunnel ventilation system; the visibility is required to be greater than the minimum vehicle stopping distance at the design speed (Permanent International Association of Road Congresses (PIARC) 2012). Visibility is reduced by the scattering and absorption of light by particles suspended in the air. The measurement of visibility in a tunnel (using an opacity meter) is based on the concept that a light beam ‘decays’ (reduces in intensity) as it passes through air. The level of decay can thus be used to determine the opacity of the air. For tunnel ventilation, visibility is expressed by the extinction coefficient K.

The amount of light scattering or absorption is dependent upon the composition, diameter and density of the particles in the air. Particles that affect visibility are generally in a size range of 0.4 to 1.0 micrometres.

<table id="table-9-4">

  </tbody>
</table>

The operational extinction coefficient limit of 0.005 m-1 may result in tunnel emissions being visible under congested conditions, but not at sufficient levels to produce hazy conditions (PIARC 2012).

##### Air quality at tunnel ventilation outlets

The tunnel would be designed and operated to avoid emissions from the tunnel portals as far as practicable. Elevated ventilation outlets, one at each end of the tunnel, would be designed and constructed as described in Chapter 5 (Project description) and Chapter 6 (Construction works). Tall tunnel ventilation outlets are effective in dispersing emissions from tunnels using the momentum and buoyancy of the plume. A combination of the design height of the outlet and the amount of fresh air mixed with the contaminated air from a tunnel can be used to ensure appropriate dilution and compliance with local air quality standards. The project ventilation outlet heights and locations are shown in Table 9.19.

##### Ambient air quality standards and goals

An ambient air quality standard defines a metric relating to the concentration of an air pollutant in the ambient air. The term ‘standard’ is used here to refer to the numerical value of the concentration for a given pollutant in legislation. The Approved Methods for the Modelling and Assessment of Air Pollutants in NSW (NSW DEC 2005b) (Approved Methods) refer to ‘impact assessment criteria’, and this terminology is also used here.

An air quality standard is typically expressed as a concentration limit for a given averaging period (eg annual mean or 24-hour mean), which may either be stated as a ‘not-to-be-exceeded’ value or permit some exceedances. Several averaging periods may be used for the same pollutant to address long- term and short-term exposure.

In 1998 Australia adopted a National Environment Protection (Ambient Air Quality) Measure (AAQ NEPM), with the goal of ensuring compliance with air quality standards within 10 years of commencement, in order to attain ’ambient air quality that allows for the adequate protection of human health and wellbeing’. The AAQ NEPM established national standards for six pollutants:

* Carbon monoxide (CO)
* Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
* Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
* Lead (Pb)
* Photochemical oxidants as ozone (O3)
* Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10).

The AAQ NEPM was extended in 2003 to include advisory reporting standards for PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). The impact assessment criteria for these pollutants are shown in Table 9.5.

###### Air toxics

Air toxics are gaseous or particulate organic pollutants that are present in the air in low concentrations, but are defined on the basis that they are, for example, highly toxic, carcinogenic or highly persistent in the environment, so as to be a hazard to humans, plants or animal life. Sources of air toxics include motor vehicles, solid fuel combustion, industry, and materials such as paints and adhesives in new buildings.

In recognition of the potential health effects of exposure to air toxics, the National Environment Protection (Air Toxics) Measure (Air Toxics NEPM) identifies ‘investigation levels’ for five priority pollutants: benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylenes and benzo(a)pyrene (as a marker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). These are not compliance standards, but are used to assess the significance of monitored levels of air toxics with respect to protection of human health.

#### 9.2.4 NSW assessment criteria

The Australian states and territories manage emissions and air quality. In NSW the statutory methods used for assessing air pollution from stationary sources are listed in the NSW Approved Methods (NSW DEC 2005b).

The metrics, criteria and goals set out for criteria pollutants in the NSW Approved Methods are listed in Table 9.6. The PM2.5 advisory standards are designed for the evaluation of overall population exposure rather than the impacts of a specific facility, and there is no requirement to evaluate PM2.5 in the NSW Approved Methods. However, they are often considered to be applicable.

The Approved Methods document specifies air quality criteria for many other substances (mostly hydrocarbons), including air toxics. The SEARs for the project require an evaluation of BTEX compounds: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The impact assessment criteria in the Approved Methods priority air toxics and BTEX compounds are given in Table 9.7. From a health perspective the annual average is the most relevant metric for air toxics, as the main effects are chronic in nature.

##### Pollutants and metrics excluded from the project assessment

The following pollutants and metrics were not considered to be relevant to the ambient air quality assessment of the project (nor to road transport projects in general):

* Sulfur dioxide (SO2). Although SO2 is emitted from road vehicles, SO2 emissions are directly proportional to the sulfur content of the fuel, and given that petrol and diesel in NSW now contain less than 50 ppm and 10 ppm of sulfur respectively, the emissions of SO2 are very low. Sulfur dioxide is therefore not a major concern in terms of transport related air quality
* Lead. The removal of lead from petrol means that it is no longer considered to be an air quality problem other than in relation to specific industrial activities, such as smelting
* Total suspended particulate (TSP). For road transport, TSP can be broadly assumed to be equivalent to PM10, and therefore within the controlling standard.  While this is certainly the case for exhaust particles, it is possible that some non-exhaust particles are greater than 10 μm in diameter
* Ozone (O3). Because of its secondary and regional nature, ozone cannot practicably be considered in a local air quality assessment. In addition, the changes in emissions associated with the project were well below the thresholds that trigger an ozone assessment (see section 9.7.2)
* Hydrogen fluoride (HF). The standards for HF relate to sensitive vegetation rather than human health, and HF is not a pollutant that is relevant to road vehicle operation.

There are currently no standards for assessment of ‘ultrafine’ particles. These are particles with a diameter of less than 0.1 μm. While there is some evidence that particles in this size range are associated with adverse health effects, it is not currently practical to incorporate them into an environmental impact assessment. There are several reasons for this, including the rapid transformation of such particles in the atmosphere, the need to treat ultrafine’ particles in terms of number rather than mass, the lack of robust emission factors, the lack of robust concentration response functions, the lack of ambient background measurements, and the absence of air quality standards

In relation to concentration response functions, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (2013) has stated the following:

> the richest set of studies provides quantitative information for PM2.5. For ultrafine particle numbers, no general risk functions have been published yet, and there are far fewer studies available. Therefore, at this time, a health impact assessment for ultrafine particles is not recommended.’

For the purpose of the project assessment it has therefore been assumed that the effects of ultrafine’ particles on health are adequately represented by those of PM2.5.

#### 9.2.5 Modelling scenarios

##### Overview

Two types of scenario were considered for ambient air quality:

* Expected traffic scenarios
* Regulatory worst case scenarios.

For the expected traffic scenarios the following were determined:

* The total concentration for comparison against NSW impact assessment criteria and international air quality standards
* The contributions of the different sources (background, surface roads and ventilation outlets)
* The change in the total concentration associated with the project. The results are presented as:
* Pollutant concentrations at discrete receptors (in charts and tables)
* Pollutant concentrations across the modelling domain (as contour plots).

##### Expected traffic scenarios

The expected traffic scenarios included in the operational ambient air quality assessment are summarised in Table 9.8. The scenarios took into account changes over time in the composition and performance of the vehicle fleet, as well as predicted traffic volumes and the distribution of traffic on the road network.  The results from the modelling of these scenarios were also used in the health risk assessment for the project (described in Chapter 11).

Future year land use projections and infrastructure were included in the traffic modelling to understand the level of traffic demand and associated travel patterns, including induced demand. The air quality scenarios modelled used the expected traffic conditions in the corresponding years in terms of volume, composition and speed, as represented in the WestConnex Road Traffic Model (WRTM).

The traffic demand scenarios used for the assessment of the project are shown in Table 9.8.

###### 2014 base year

For the purpose of the air quality assessment, a 2014 base year was used. This was used to establish existing conditions. The inclusion of a base year enables the dispersion modelling methodology to be verified against real-world air pollution monitoring data. The base year also provided a current baseline that helped to define underlying trends in projected emissions and air quality, and provided a sense of scale and context for the project impacts.

###### 2021 ‘do minimum’

2021 was adopted as the primary year for forecasting impacts of the project. The primary ‘do minimum’ case assumes that the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and M4 Widening projects are complete, but that the remainder of the WestConnex projects are not built. It is called ‘do minimum’ rather than ‘do nothing’ as it assumes that infrastructure schemes currently incomplete but scheduled for opening prior to the assessment year are operational.

###### 2021 ‘do something’

As per the primary 'do minimum' scenario, this represents conditions with the project complete and open to traffic, but without any other subsequent WestConnex projects. .It is considered that traffic patterns would be more stable by 2021 than immediately after opening in 2019.

###### 2031 ‘do minimum’

2031 was adopted as the case for 10 years after the primary year, and was considered to allow for full ramp-up of traffic demand as travellers respond to the provision of the fully completed WestConnex and the associated tolls The ‘do minimum’ scenario assumes a future network, including the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and M4 Widening projects, and some upgrades to the broader transport network over time to improve capacity and cater for traffic growth, but does not include the other subsequent WestConnex projects.

###### 2031 ‘do something’

This scenario assumes all WestConnex projects are complete, and also includes the Sydney Gateway and the Southern Extension.

###### 2031 ‘do something (cumulative)’

This is an additional 'do something' scenario with the M4 East, New M5 and M4–M5 Link projects in place. This excludes contributions from the New M5 ventilation outlets (including the shared outlet with the M4–M5 Link), because of their geographical distance from the project. In other words, it was assumed that there would be no ‘overlap’ in the areas affected by the emissions from the M4 East and New M5 ventilation outlets (approximately six to eight kilometres away).

##### Regulatory worst case scenarios

The objective of these scenarios was to demonstrate that compliance with the emission limits for the tunnel ventilation outlets would guarantee acceptable ambient air quality.

The scenarios were:

* RWC-A. This scenario applied to the project only. The same ventilation outlets and assumptions were applicable in 2021 and 2031
* RWC-B. This scenario applied to the project and the M4-M5 Link, taking into account the additional ventilation outlets.

These scenarios assessed constant ventilation outlet concentrations (at maximum allowable limits) over a 24-hour period, to provide a representation of the theoretical maximum changes in air quality across all potential operational modes, including unconstrained and worst case traffic conditions (from an emissions perspective) as well as vehicle breakdown situations. The concentration limits for the ventilation outlets are shown in Table 9.9 and were taken from the NorthConnex Instrument of Approval. These limits were converted to mass emission rates (in kilograms per hour, or kg/h) based on assumed ventilation settings. A ‘medium’ level air flow of 400 cubic metres per second (m3/s) was assumed for each outlet, with the corresponding number of fans in operation, effective outlet diameters and exit velocities. Sensitivity tests were also conducted using alternative ‘high’ (800 m3/s) and ‘low’ (200 m3/s) air flows with corresponding outlet conditions and emission rates, but these gave results that were very similar to those for the medium air flow case and have therefore not been reported here.

The ventilation outlet assumptions for the regulatory worst case scenarios are shown in Appendix H (Table 8.19) and the results are presented in section 9.7.3.

The analysis was undertaken to assist regulatory authorities in assessing and determining potential ventilation outlet concentration limits that could be applied through conditions of approval. Assuming that concentration limits are applied to the ventilation outlets, the results of the analysis will demonstrate the air quality performance of the project if it operates continuously at the limits. In reality, ventilation outlet concentrations would vary over a daily cycle due to changing traffic volumes and tunnel fan operation.

The assumptions underpinning the worst case scenarios were very conservative, and resulted in contributions from project ventilation outlets that were much higher than could realistically occur under any operational conditions in the tunnel.

#### 9.2.6 Accuracy and conservatism

There is generally a desire for a small amount of conservatism in air quality assessments. The reasons for this include the following:


* Allowing for uncertainty. An assessment on the scale undertaken for this project is a complex, multi-step process that involves a range of assumptions, inputs, models and post-processing procedures. There is an inherent uncertainty in each of the methods used to estimate emissions and concentrations, and there are clearly limits to how accurately any impacts in future years can be predicted. Conservatism is built into predictions to ensure that a margin of safety is applied (ie to minimise the risk that any potential impacts are underestimated)
* Providing flexibility. It is not desirable to define the potential environmental impacts of a project too narrowly in the early stages of the development process. A conservative approach provides flexibility, allowing for ongoing design refinements within an approved environmental envelope (AECOM 2014).

Conversely, excessive conservatism in an assessment risks overstating potential air quality impacts and associated human health risks. This, in turn, may lead to some undesirable outcomes that need to be mitigated and managed. An overly conservative approach may create, or contribute to, concerns within the local community and among other stakeholders about the impacts of the project. It may lead to additional, or more stringent, conditions of approval than necessary, including requirements for the mitigation, monitoring and management of air quality. Overstatement of vehicle contributions to local air quality may also lead to overstating the benefit where vehicle emissions are reduced by the project (AECOM 2014).

Air quality assessments therefore need to strike a balance between these potentially conflicting requirements.

The operational air quality assessment for the project has been conducted, as far as possible, with the intention of providing ‘accurate’ or ‘realistic’ estimates of pollutant emissions and concentrations. The general approach has been to use inputs, models and procedures that are as accurate as possible, except where the context dictates that a degree of conservatism is sensible. An example of this is the estimation of the maximum one-hour NO2 concentration during a given year. Any method that provides a ‘typical’ or ‘average’ one-hour NO2 concentration will tend to result in an underestimate of the likely maximum concentration, and therefore a more conservative approach is required.

However, the scale of the conservatism can be difficult to define, and this can sometimes result in assumptions being overly conservative. Skill and experience is required to estimate impacts that err on the side of caution but are not unreasonably exaggerated or otherwise skewed. By demonstrating that a deliberate overestimate of impacts is acceptable, it can be confidently predicted that the actual impacts that are likely to be experienced in reality would also lie within acceptable limits (AECOM 2014b).

#### 9.2.7 Model selection and validation

Both the emissions and dispersion models were validated for use in the assessment of this project. The Graz Lagangrian (GRAL) dispersion model (version 14.11) was selected for this study, and was validated by comparing predicted and measured concentrations in the 2014 base year.

GRAL was chosen because it is:

* Suitable for regulatory applications and can utilise a full year of meteorological data
* Able to predict low wind speed conditions (less than one metre per second) better than most other models
* Specifically designed for the simultaneous modelling of road transport networks, including line sources (surface roads), point sources (tunnel ventilation outlets) and other sources
* Able to take into account vehicle wake effects
* Able to characterise pollution dispersion in complex local terrain and topography, including the presence of buildings in urban areas
* Validated in a wide range of studies featuring complex and flat terrain and with varying meteorological conditions (high/low wind speeds, stable/unstable atmospheric conditions etc.

While the GRAL system has not been used extensively in Australia, it was used in the assessment of the Waterview Connection tunnels near Auckland, New Zealand.  The model set up for this project has been tailored to suit the needs of both the study at hand and the regulatory requirements in NSW in relation to air quality.

The GRAL model is described in more detail in Appendix H. The method and results of the evaluation are given in Appendix I of the air quality assessment report provided in Appendix H, and are summarised below.

GRAL was configured to provide concentration predictions for each main pollutant (CO, NOX, NO2 and PM10) at each of nine air quality monitoring sites (seven background and two roadside) in the WestConnex GRAL domain and for the full 2014 base year. The WestConnex and M4 East model domains are described in section 9.4.2. PM2.5 was not included as no independent testing of the model performance for PM2.5 was possible.

The GRAL predictions were for the combined surface road network and the existing M5 East tunnel ventilation outlet. For each monitoring site the GRAL predictions were extracted for an hourly time series of concentrations for 2014. These were combined with an estimated background contribution for each monitoring site.

The performance of GRAL was also investigated for the project-specific air quality monitoring stations. Given that only partial monitoring data for 2014 were available at each site, the comparisons between the model and the measurements were made for the monitoring period covered at each site.

The vehicle emission models used in the in-tunnel and ambient air quality assessments were validated by comparison with the EPA measured emissions from the Lane Cove Tunnel (see Appendix E of the air quality assessment in Appendix H).

#### 9.2.8 Sensitivity tests

A number of sensitivity tests were conducted to investigate the effects of varying the key assumptions in the ambient air quality assessment (Appendix H). These included:

* The influence of ventilation outlet temperature
* The influence of ventilation outlet height
* The inclusion of buildings near tunnel ventilation outlets.

These tests were based on a sub-area of the M4 East GRAL domain of approximately two kilometres by two kilometres around the project’s eastern ventilation outlet. Only the ventilation outlet contribution, and only annual mean PM2.5 and maximum 24-hour PM2.5, were included in the tests. A sub-set of 14 sensitive receptors was evaluated. The predicted concentrations were indicative, as the aim of the sensitivity tests was to assess the proportional sensitivity of the model to specific input parameters.

### 9.3 Construction air quality assessment methodology

Activities on construction ancillary facilities can be categorised into four types (as noted in Figure 9.1) to reflect their potential impacts. The potential for dust emissions is then assessed for each likely activity in each category:

* Demolition is any activity that involves the removal of existing structures
* Earthworks covers the processes of soil stripping, ground levelling, excavation and landscaping.  Earthworks primarily involves excavating material, haulage, tipping and stockpiling
* Construction is any activity that involves the provision of new structures, or modification or refurbishment of existing structures. ‘Structures’ include buildings, ventilation outlets and roads
* Track-out involves the transport of dust and dirt from the construction/demolition site onto the public road network on construction vehicles. These materials may then be deposited and re-suspended by vehicles using the network.

It is very difficult to _quantify_ dust emissions from construction activities, since it is not possible to predict the weather conditions that will prevail during specific construction activities. In any case, the effects of construction on airborne particle concentrations would generally be temporary and relatively short-lived, and mitigation should be straightforward, since dust suppression measures are routinely employed as ‘good practice’ on most construction ancillary facilities. It is therefore more usual to provide a _qualitative_ assessment of potential construction dust impacts. This approach follows the guidance published by the UK Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) (2014), the aim of which is to identify risks and recommend appropriate mitigation measures.

Construction activities would occur at several sites within the project area, as described in Chapter 6 (Construction work). Many of these activities would be transitory. The majority of the construction footprint would be underground; however, surface works would be required to support tunnelling activities and to construct surface infrastructure such as interchanges, tunnel portals, ventilation facilities, ancillary operations buildings and facilities, and the eastbound cycleway near the Homebush Bay Drive interchange.

The guidance published by the IAQM (2014) was used for the assessment of air quality during construction (see Appendix H). The IAQM guidance has been adapted for use in NSW, taking into account factors such as the assessment criteria for ambient PM10 concentrations. The potential construction air quality impacts have been assessed based on the proposed works, plant and equipment, and the potential emission sources and levels.

The IAQM procedure for assessing construction dust impacts is shown in Figure 9.1.

<figure id="figure-9-1">
  <img src="images/figure-9-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the steps in assessing construction dust" />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 9.1 Steps in an assessment of construction dust (IAQM 2014)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The main air pollution and amenity issues at construction ancillary facilities are:

* Dust deposition (soiling of surfaces) and visible dust plumes
* Elevated PM10 concentrations due to dust-generating activities
* Exhaust emissions from diesel-powered construction equipment.

The assessment methodology considers three dust impacts:

* Annoyance due to dust deposition (soiling of surfaces)
* The risk of health effects from increased exposure to PM10
* Harm to ecological receptors.

The risk of dust impacts from a demolition/construction ancillary facility causing loss of amenity and/or health or ecological impacts is related to the following (IAQM 2014):

* The nature of the activities being undertaken
* The duration of the activities
* The size of the site
* The meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction and rainfall). Adverse impacts are more likely to occur downwind of the site and during drier periods
* The proximity of receptors to the activities
* The sensitivity of the receptors to dust
* The adequacy of the mitigation measures applied to reduce or eliminate dust.

### 9.4 Operational assessment methodology

Details of the various components of the operational assessment methodology are provided in Appendix H and a summary of the in-tunnel and external air quality assessment is provided below.

#### 9.4.1 In-tunnel assessment methodology

The in-tunnel traffic, airflow, pollution level and temperature have been modelled using the EQUA AB software IDA Tunnel, which models air flows and pollutant concentrations. A traffic model within the simulation applies traffic continuity and realistic rules on traffic flow versus speed, to predict the traffic density and speed throughout the tunnel. The resulting airflows, in combination with the vehicle emissions, determine the pollutant levels in the tunnel.

This software was used to model tunnel ventilation and pollution concentrations under varying traffic flows, from free-flowing to congested conditions, for the years 2021 and 2031, over a 24-hour period on a summer and a winter day.

##### Congested traffic (maximum traffic flow) scenario

Multi-lane tunnels have an advantage in mitigating congestion, in that slow vehicles can occupy the left lane, allowing the remaining lanes to accommodate faster moving traffic. The notion of uniformly slow moving traffic throughout a tunnel in the absence of an accident or other incident is unrealistic. Since ventilation simulation software and other calculation methods do not consider this speed difference between lanes, they underestimate the aerodynamic effect of vehicles and produce lower estimates of tunnel air flow and higher estimates of in-tunnel pollution, especially for congested cases where the speed difference between lanes is significant.

When congestion does occur in the model simulations, it is associated with high traffic demand at entry portals and occurs locally where traffic merges, or at steep exit ramps where congestion may extend back into the mainline tunnel.  Since traffic flow is compressible, especially in a long tunnel, some sections can flow freely while others are congested.

Two real life congestion scenarios have been simulated:

* A single lane closure in the three-lane mainline tunnel
* Congestion at the exit portals.

Traffic simulation within the IDA Tunnel model shows that these events do not produce severe drops in traffic speed throughout the mainline tunnel. In order to generate severe congestion along the mainline, it was necessary to apply a traffic speed limit; this is a somewhat artificial method of producing the severe congestion scenarios required for ventilation design.

Emissions from the total vehicle ‘fleet’ in Sydney were calculated based on:

* Australia-specific emission factors (PIARC 2012 and the air quality assessment contained in Appendix H
* Traffic volumes taken from the WRTM, as discussed in Chapter 8 (Traffic and Transport)
* Traffic mix (existing M4 traffic data, weigh-in-motion studies), as discussed in Chapter 8
* Tunnel alignment and geometry.

In-tunnel vehicle emissions were modelled following PIARC (2012) methods, with the Australian fleet specifications extrapolated to 2020 and used for both the 20121 and 2031 scenarios (Appendix L of the air quality assessment in Appendix H).

#### 9.4.2 External air quality assessment methodology

The operational ambient air quality assessment was based on the GRAMM/GRAL modelling system. This system consists of two main modules: a prognostic wind field model (the Graz Mesoscale Model, or GRAMM) and a dispersion model (GRAL).  The elements of the system are shown in Figure 9.2 and summarised below. Full details of the methodology are presented in the air quality assessment report in Appendix H.

The GRAL dispersion model is a three-dimensional model used to predict pollutant concentrations. It is suitable for regulatory applications and can use a full year of meteorological data. It predicts pollutant concentrations under low wind speed conditions less than one metre per second) more accurately than Gaussian models (eg CALINE). It is specifically designed for the simultaneous modelling of surface roads, point sources (tunnel ventilation outlets) and tunnel portals, and takes into account vehicle wake effects.

GRAL characterises pollution dispersion in complex local terrain and topography, including the presence of buildings in urban areas. It has been validated in a wide range of studies featuring complex and flat terrain, and with different meteorological conditions such as high and low wind velocities, and stable or unstable atmospheric conditions (Appendix I of the Air Quality Assessment Report in Appendix H) and is not inherently conservative (see discussion of conservatism in section 9.2.6).

##### Definition of modelling domains

The modelling domains for the project are shown in Figure 9.3. The following terms are used in this report to describe the different geographical areas of the assessment:

* The GRAMM domain (also referred to as the ‘study area’) is shown by the red boundary in Figure 9.3. This was used for the modelling of meteorology, and was the largest area included in the assessment. The GRAMM domain covers a substantial part of Sydney, extending 25 kilometres in the east-west (x) alignment and 20 kilometres in the north-south (y) alignment.
* The WestConnex GRAL domain for dispersion modelling is shown by the black boundary in Figure 9.3. This extended 15 kilometres in the east-west alignment and 14 kilometres in the north-south alignment. Every dispersion model was run undertaken for the WestConnex GRAL domain, which includes all WestConnex projects (a section of the M4 Widening, M4 East, King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade, New M5 and M4􏰁M5 Link). The large size of the WestConnex GRAL domain was defined for a number of reasons:
* It facilitated a ‘whole of project’ modelling approach, whereby the specific information for each WestConnex project could be extracted and presented in more detail for the separate EISs (in this case, for the M4 East project). This improved both the efficiency and consistency of the air quality assessments for the various WestConnex projects
* It provided the cumulative impacts of all relevant projects, such as the combined ventilation outlet for the M4 East and M4-M5 Link
* It maximised the flexibility of the assessment process, and is capable of accommodating any future changes in the requirements of any project
* It maximised the number of meteorological and air quality monitoring stations that could be included for model evaluation purposes.
* The M4 East GRAL domain is shown by the blue boundary in Figure 9.3. This extended 8.5 kilometres in the east-west alignment and 6.2 kilometres in the north-south alignment. No separate modelling was undertaken for this domain; rather, the model results for this area were extracted from the model results for the WestConnex GRAL domain.

##### Determination of components of assessment

The various pollutant concentrations were determined as follows:

* Background concentrations were based on measurements from air quality monitoring stations at urban background locations in the study area, but well away from roads (as defined in Australian Standard AS/NZS 3580.1.1:2007). The approaches used to determine long-term and short-term background concentrations are explained in Appendix F of the air quality assessment in Appendix H.  Background concentrations were assumed to remain unchanged in future years
* Surface road concentrations and ventilation outlet concentrations were estimated (separately) using the GRAL dispersion model
* For all pollutants except NO2, as the background concentration was the same with and without the project, the project increment was equal to the difference between the road concentration (surface roads and ventilation outlets) with and without the project. A different method was required for NO2to account for the atmospheric chemistry in the roadside environment (see Appendix G of the air quality assessment in Appendix H).

##### Receptors

Appendix H presents contour maps showing concentrations, and changes in concentration, across the entire M4 East GRAL domain. The concentrations are based on a Cartesian grid of points with an equal spacing of 10 metres in the x and y directions. This results in 527,000 grid locations across the M4 East GRAL domain.

This report also presents distributions of changes in concentration at over 10,000 discrete receptor locations along the project corridor where people are likely to be present for some period of the day. Two types of discrete receptor locations were defined for use in the assessment:

* ‘Community receptors’. These were taken to be representative of particularly sensitive locations within a zone (600 metres either side) along the project corridor, such as schools, child care centres and hospitals. For these receptors a detailed approach was used to calculate the total concentration of each pollutant. This involved the combination of the contemporaneous road/outlet time series of concentrations from GRAL and the background time series of concentrations, stated as a one-hour mean for each hour of the year in each case. The number of such receptors that could be treated in this was dictated by the limit on the number of time series that could be extracted from GRAL. In total, 31 community receptors were included in the assessment
* ‘Residential, workplace and recreational (RWR) receptors’. These were all discrete receptor locations along the project corridor, and mainly covered residential and commercial land uses. The 31 community receptors were also included. For these receptors a simpler statistical approach was used to combine a concentration statistic for the modelled roads and outlets (eg maximum 24-hour mean PM10, annual mean NOX) with an appropriate background statistic. Around 10,000 RWR receptors were included in the assessment.

The RWR receptors are discrete points in space, classified according to the land use identified at that location. The RWR receptors do not identify the number of residential (or other) properties at the location. The residential land use at an RWR receptor location may range from a single-storey dwelling to a multi-storey, multi-dwelling building. The RWR receptors are therefore not designed for the assessment of changes in total population exposure. The human health risk assessment (Appendix J) combines the air quality information with the highest available resolution population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to calculate key health indicators that reflect population- weighted change in concentrations across the study area.

Although not all particularly sensitive receptors along the project corridor were included in the first type, they were included in the second type. This included, for example, aged care facilities and some additional schools. This approach was considered to be appropriate, in that it allowed all relevant receptors to be included in the assessment whilst recognising model limitations Community receptors are listed in Table 9.10. RWR receptor types are listed in Table 9.11. The locations of both types of receptor are shown in Figure 9.4.
