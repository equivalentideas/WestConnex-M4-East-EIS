Prepared by AECOM Australia Pty Ltd, GHD Pty Ltd

## 8. Traffic and transport

This chapter outlines the potential traffic and transport impacts associated with the M4 East project (the project). A detailed traffic and transport assessment has been undertaken for the project and is included in Appendix G.

The Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment has issued a set of environmental assessment requirements for the project; these are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 8.1 sets out these requirements as they relate to traffic and transport, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).

### 8.1 Assessment methodology

An integrated traffic modelling and forecasting approach was adopted for the
traffic assessment for the project. This approach involved:

* Reviewing existing conditions along the Parramatta Road corridor
* Determining existing and future intersection and roadway traffic volumes
* Assessing potential construction impacts
* Assessing potential operational impacts of the project on the existing and future road network using LinSig, which is an intersection modelling platform that is capable of assessing the performance of isolated or coordinated networks of signalised intersections
* Recommending measures to mitigate and manage the traffic and transport impacts of the project during construction and operation.

A summary of the main tasks involved in the assessment is provided in sections 8.1.1 to 8.1.4. A detailed description of the methodology is provided in Appendix G.

### 8.1.1 Determine existing and future traffic volumes

Existing and future year intersection and roadway traffic volumes were
calculated using outputs from the WestConnex Road Traffic Model (WRTM) Version
2.1, with a particular focus on the project area between Homebush Bay Drive at
Homebush and Balmain Road at Leichhardt, and including the predicted transfer of
principal and induced travel demand to the project from alternative transport
corridors.

The following six key scenarios were modelled using the WRTM to provide morning
(AM) peak and afternoon (PM) peak roadway and intersection turning volumes:

* Existing case (2012) – current road network with no new projects or upgrades
* Construction ‘do minimum’ (2017) – current road network with the inclusion of the completed M4 Widening project
* Operation ‘do minimum’ (2021) – assumes that the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and the M4 Widening projects are complete, but the remaining WestConnex projects, including the M4 East, are not built. It is called ‘do minimum’ rather than ‘do nothing’ as it assumes that projects currently incomplete but scheduled for opening prior to the assessment year are operational, thus the network conditions are different to the 'Existing case (2012)'
* Operation 'do something' (2021) – as per 'do minimum' with the M4 East complete and open to traffic, but without any other proposed future WestConnex projects, This scenario includes provision of kerbside bus lanes on Parramatta Road between Burwood Road at Burwood and Chandos Street at Haberfield/Ashfield (however, these bus lanes do not form part of the project)
* Operation ‘do minimum’ (2031) – a future network including the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and M4 Widening projects and some upgrades to the broader transport network, but does not include the project or any other proposed future WestConnex projects
* Operation 'do something' (2031) – all WestConnex projects are complete, and also includes the Sydney Gateway and the Southern Extension. Bus lanes were included in this scenario as per the 2021 ‘do something’ scenario, along with an eastbound bus lane from west of Hume Highway at Ashfield to east of Sloane Street at Haberfield/Summer Hill, and a westbound bus lane from west of Norton Street at Leichhardt to Hume Highway at Ashfield (however, these bus lanes do not form part of the project).

### 8.1.2 Assess construction impacts

The construction impact assessment involved an assessment of anticipated
construction related vehicles travelling to, from, and within the project
footprint on the existing M4, Parramatta Road and local roads that would provide
access to construction ancillary facilities. Based on the construction program,
the fourth quarter of 2017 has been used as the assessment year for construction
impacts, as this is when peak construction traffic volumes are expected.

### 8.1.3 Assess operational impacts

LinSig traffic models were developed to determine the operational performance of
the existing and future road network during the AM and PM peak periods. The
modelling included interchanges with the project intersections along Parramatta
Road and the surrounding road network in the vicinity of the project.

Following the calibration of AM peak and PM peak base LinSig models, future year
networks and traffic demands were developed for the five key modelling scenarios
to be assessed:

* 2017 future year construction model
* 2021 and 2031 future year 'do minimum' models
* 2021 and 2031 future year 'do something' models.


The objective of the 'do minimum' models was to provide a benchmark to compare
the operational performance of the 'do something' scenarios against future
network conditions without the project and subsequent WestConnex stages.

The operational traffic assessment also included crash analysis, travel speeds
and travel time analysis, and opportunities to enhance public and active
transport networks within the project area.

### 8.2 Existing environment

#### 8.2.1 Route description

Figure 8.1 shows the road network in the vicinity of the project.

##### Parramatta Road

Parramatta Road is classified as a State Significant Road and forms a major
east–west Sydney metropolitan road corridor. The road extends from the
intersection of the M4 and Church Street at Granville in the west, to Broadway
on the south-western outskirts of the Sydney CBD in the east. It connects to
several other major east–west road corridors, including the M4.

The road varies between two and three lanes in each direction. In the eastbound
direction, two lanes are provided from Homebush Bay Drive to Bedford Road at
Homebush West, then three lanes to Knight Street at Homebush. Parramatta Road
then narrows to two lanes to Concord Road at North Strathfield/Concord, and then
widens to three lanes to Sloane Street at Haberfield. Continuing east, beyond
the project area, two lanes remain after Sloane Street up until immediately
after Flood Street at Leichhardt, where a bus lane is added.

In the westbound direction, two lanes are provided from Crystal Street at
Petersham to Norton Street at Leichhardt, where it widens to three lanes. The
road narrows to two lanes just after Liverpool Road (Hume Highway) at Ashfield,
and then widens to three lanes after Dalhousie Street at Haberfield, where it
continues as three lanes to the intersection with the existing M4. The approach
to the M4 consists of one through lane and two right-turn lanes to the M4
westbound, which extend back to Phillip Street at Strathfield. Continuing west,
the configuration increases to two lanes from Concord Road at North
Strathfield/Concord to George Street at North Strathfield, followed by three
lanes from George Street to Homebush Bay Drive.

Parramatta Road has a posted speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour in both
directions. There are 22 signalised intersections along the 9.6 kilometre long
section of the road between Centenary Drive/Homebush Bay Drive at Homebush and
Orpington Street at Ashfield.

In the vicinity of the project, Parramatta Road is of local and regional
importance. It provides the main route for road vehicles travelling to, from, or
through the corridor. The main Parramatta Road transport corridor accommodates a
mix of travel demand characteristics that range from short local trips to longer
through vehicle movements. The diverse types of business along the Parramatta
Road transport corridor service both the local and wider community, meaning that
a number of medium distance, one way trips are generated along the corridor.

  <img src="images/fig-8.1.png" alt="Map of Traffic study area" />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 8.1 Existing road network within the study area
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Adjacent transport corridors in the vicinity of the project, such as the Hume
Highway, Wattle Street, Concord Road and the M4, connect Parramatta Road to
major centres across the Sydney metropolitan area.

Parramatta Road currently accommodates high levels of demand to and from the M4,
but functions as an arterial roadway, generally favouring through movements.

##### M4 Motorway

The M4 extends between the Blue Mountains at its western end and Parramatta Road
at Concord at its eastern end. The M4 and Parramatta Road transport corridor is
the main road freight, commercial and passenger route between the Sydney CBD,
the inner-western suburbs, Parramatta, greater western Sydney and beyond to the
Blue Mountains.

The M4 varies from two to four lanes in each direction, with on-ramps merging
with the mainline carriageways in some locations resulting in operational
constraints. East of Homebush Bay Drive, the posted speed limit varies between
60 and 90 kilometres per hour in each direction.

Work on the M4 Widening project began in March 2015. This project involves
widening the M4 between Pitt Street at Parramatta and Homebush Bay Drive at
Homebush, to include generally four lanes in each direction. The M4 Widening
project also includes a new access from Hill Road to the M4 eastbound and a new
on-ramp southbound from Homebush Bay Drive to the M4 westbound.

##### East–west routes

Alternative east–west arterial roads located in the vicinity of the project
include:

* Frederick Street/Wattle Street/Dobroyd Parade/City West Link – this route, which is about 2.8 kilometres long, is a major connector between Sydney’s western and south-western suburbs and the Sydney CBD. It carries high volumes of traffic and provides an alternative route to Parramatta Road into Sydney CBD from inner-southern and inner-western Sydney
* Queens Road/Gipps Street/Patterson Street – this route extends about 3.4 kilometres from its intersection with Great North Road and Fairlight Street at Five Dock in the east, to Concord Road at Concord in the west. It provides an alternative route between Five Dock and Concord/M4 and serves a significant number of local businesses
* Hume Highway/Liverpool Road – this route, located to the south of Parramatta Road, is classified as a State Significant Road and provides an important metropolitan connection for both local and regional traffic. It extends from Liverpool in south-western Sydney, to join Parramatta Road near Summer Hill in the east, about 450 metres south-east of the project.

##### North–south routes

Key north–south arterial roads within the study area include:

* Homebush Bay Drive/Centenary Drive – this route extends about 6.5 kilometres between the northern Concord Road intersection at Rhodes and southern Hume Highway/Roberts Road intersection at Strathfield/Greenacre. It links the St George region, Sydney Olympic Park, Ryde, Sydney’s northern suburbs and the Northern Beaches. It includes east and west facing ramps to and from the M4.  There are four signalised intersections along this corridor
* Concord Road/Leicester Avenue – this route extends about five kilometres between the intersection with Church Street at Meadowbank and the intersection with Everton Road at Strathfield. The Homebush Bay Drive/Centenary Drive route connects to Concord Road in Rhodes. Therefore, both routes share a similar north–south connectivity function in terms of linking the St George region with Sydney’s northern suburbs. However, Concord Road intersects with Parramatta Road further to the east and provides access to Strathfield rather than to Sydney Olympic Park. East facing ramps on the northern side of Parramatta Road provide direct access to and from the M4
* Great North Road and Lyons Road – extends about four kilometres through Five Dock and Drummoyne. It provides a north–east connection between Parramatta Road and Victoria Road.

#### 8.2.2 Traffic volumes and patterns

To understand and analyse existing traffic volumes and patterns in the vicinity
of the project, traffic surveys were undertaken between 2012 and 2014. The
surveys recorded hourly traffic volumes at seven locations over a one week
survey period. Survey locations are shown in Figure 8.2.

The following volumes are shown in Table 8.2 for the seven survey sites:

* AM peak: morning single hour peak recorded between 6.00 am and 10.00 am
* PM peak: evening single hour peak recorded between 3.00 pm and 7.00 pm
* Average weekday traffic (AWT) volume: daily traffic volume – derived from 24 hour traffic counts recorded between Monday and Friday during the survey week
* Average daily traffic (ADT) volume: daily traffic volume – derived from 24 hour traffic counts recorded between Monday and Sunday during the survey week.

</figure>

The following key findings can be drawn from the traffic volumes shown in Table
8.2, and the figures in section 5.4 of the traffic and transport assessment in
Appendix G:

* Parramatta Road:
    * Two-way AWT ranges from 101,375 east of the M4 to 89,060 west of Wattle
    Street, which equates to a 12 per cent reduction in daily traffic along
    Parramatta Road between these two locations. Moreover, AWT decreases to 63,535
    vehicles per day on Parramatta Road at the Hawthorne Canal, which is a 37 per
    cent and 29 per cent reduction in comparison to the respective volumes east of
    the M4 and west of Wattle Street
    * AWT is generally around two per cent greater than ADT at all three locations
    on Parramatta Road, by direction and in combination. This indicates that average
    daily weekend traffic is generally at similar levels to ADT and hence the road
    corridor accommodates consistently high volumes of travel demand that are not
    biased towards weekday work-related trips
    * Peak period traffic volumes show similar trends to daily figures with the
    two-way AM peak and PM peak being 6,205 and 6,035 vehicles per hour respectively
    east of the M4. Importantly, the graphics show a fairly 'flat' profile of
    traffic throughout the day between the AM peak and PM peak periods at the three
    Parramatta Road locations. This confirms that traffic volumes on Parramatta Road
    are consistent throughout an average weekday, both during and between the more
    conventional morning and evening 'peak' periods
    * Traffic surveys recorded at three locations on Parramatta Road confirm that
    there is typically an even spread of directional volumes during the AM peak, PM
    peak and daily periods. The only location that shows a considerable deviation
    from this statistic is on Parramatta Road at the Hawthorne Canal during the AM
    peak, where eastbound volumes around 30 per cent higher than westbound traffic
* Dobroyd Parade:
    * Two-way AM peak and PM peak volumes recorded on Dobroyd Parade was 3,525 and
    3,940 vehicles per hour respectively. Interestingly, the highest hourly volume
    was 2,115 vehicles in the eastbound direction during the PM peak period, which
    suggests that more vehicles are travelling towards the Sydney CBD in the evening
    * The two-way AWT volume on Dobroyd Parade is slightly less than the equivalent
    ADT figure, which suggests that traffic levels are fairly consistent across the
    seven day period, in line with patterns on the connecting Parramatta Road
    corridor
* Queens Road:
    * Directional peak period traffic volumes on Queens Road are at similar levels,
    ranging from 960 to 1045 vehicles per hour in the respective eastbound direction
    and westbound direction; during the average PM peak hour. This trend continues
    throughout the day with directional and two-way AWT and ADT volumes at similar
    levels, which peak to 27,325 vehicles during an average weekday. The profile of
    traffic across an average weekday on shows a more predictable pattern for
    two-way volumes, with more defined peaks during the morning and evening peak
    periods.
* Ramsay Street:
    * Peak hour volumes recorded on Ramsay Street are similar by direction and
    time-period, with the maximum flow around 1,000 vehicles per hour. Two-way AWT
    and ADT volumes were 26,100 and 25,155 vehicles per day, which equates to a four
    per cent increase in daily traffic during the five day period.
* Hume Highway:
    * Peak period counts on the Hume Highway show higher volumes of traffic in the
    eastbound and westbound direction during the respective AM peak and PM peak
    period. This suggests that the majority of vehicles are travelling towards the
    CBD in the morning and from the CBD in the evening.

#### 8.2.3 Existing road network performance

##### Level of service

‘Level of service’ (LoS) is a measure to determine the operational conditions
and efficiency of a roadway or intersection. The six levels of service range
from A to F, with A representing the best operating conditions and F the worst.
It is generally the practice of NSW Roads and Maritime Services (Roads and
Maritime) to initiate investigations when the level of service of a roadway or
intersection falls to D, and provide suitable remediation prior to the level of
service decreasing further E or F. Further information on the definitions and
calculation of level of service is provided in section 6.1 of the traffic and
transport assessment (Appendix G).

##### Operational performance – roadways

Levels of service along the Parramatta Road and Wattle Street corridors under
existing conditions are provided in Table 8.3 for the AM and PM peak. The
Parramatta Road corridor currently experiences high levels of mid-block traffic
demand. West of Concord Road, the level of service generally exceeds D, with the
mid-block volumes often exceeding the theoretical capacity of the road. The
results indicate that, east of the M4, there are eastbound capacity issues
during the AM peak. This reflects the relatively low traffic volumes on
Parramatta Road west of Concord Road since the removal of tolls on the M4. An
exception is east of Bland Street, where the traffic volumes on Parramatta Road
are lower due to congestion at the Wattle Street intersection. High northbound
volumes are also evident on Dobroyd Parade, reflecting city bound demand in the
morning peak. The results for the PM peak are similar, although high traffic
volumes are recorded in both directions. Low westbound traffic east of Bland
Street can be explained by congestion at the Hume Highway intersection and the
extra lane on Parramatta Road west of Dalhousie Street.

The Gipps Street and Queens Road corridor also experiences high traffic volumes
and has a level of service of E/F in both peaks, with the exception of PM
eastbound west of Great North Road. The midblock level of service for the
existing M4 is generally D, but is somewhat distorted by queuing at the
