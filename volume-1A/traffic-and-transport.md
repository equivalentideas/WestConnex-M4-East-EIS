## 8. Traffic and transport

This chapter outlines the potential traffic and transport impacts associated with the M4 East project (the project). A detailed traffic and transport assessment has been undertaken for the project and is included in Appendix G.

The Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment has issued a set of environmental assessment requirements for the project; these are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 8.1 sets out these requirements as they relate to traffic and transport, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).

### 8.1 Assessment methodology

An integrated traffic modelling and forecasting approach was adopted for the
traffic assessment for the project. This approach involved:

* Reviewing existing conditions along the Parramatta Road corridor
* Determining existing and future intersection and roadway traffic volumes
* Assessing potential construction impacts
* Assessing potential operational impacts of the project on the existing and future road network using LinSig, which is an intersection modelling platform that is capable of assessing the performance of isolated or coordinated networks of signalised intersections
* Recommending measures to mitigate and manage the traffic and transport impacts of the project during construction and operation.

A summary of the main tasks involved in the assessment is provided in sections 8.1.1 to 8.1.4. A detailed description of the methodology is provided in Appendix G.

### 8.1.1 Determine existing and future traffic volumes

Existing and future year intersection and roadway traffic volumes were
calculated using outputs from the WestConnex Road Traffic Model (WRTM) Version
2.1, with a particular focus on the project area between Homebush Bay Drive at
Homebush and Balmain Road at Leichhardt, and including the predicted transfer of
principal and induced travel demand to the project from alternative transport
corridors.

The following six key scenarios were modelled using the WRTM to provide morning
(AM) peak and afternoon (PM) peak roadway and intersection turning volumes:

* Existing case (2012) – current road network with no new projects or upgrades
* Construction ‘do minimum’ (2017) – current road network with the inclusion of the completed M4 Widening project
* Operation ‘do minimum’ (2021) – assumes that the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and the M4 Widening projects are complete, but the remaining WestConnex projects, including the M4 East, are not built. It is called ‘do minimum’ rather than ‘do nothing’ as it assumes that projects currently incomplete but scheduled for opening prior to the assessment year are operational, thus the network conditions are different to the 'Existing case (2012)'
* Operation 'do something' (2021) – as per 'do minimum' with the M4 East complete and open to traffic, but without any other proposed future WestConnex projects, This scenario includes provision of kerbside bus lanes on Parramatta Road between Burwood Road at Burwood and Chandos Street at Haberfield/Ashfield (however, these bus lanes do not form part of the project)
* Operation ‘do minimum’ (2031) – a future network including the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and M4 Widening projects and some upgrades to the broader transport network, but does not include the project or any other proposed future WestConnex projects
* Operation 'do something' (2031) – all WestConnex projects are complete, and also includes the Sydney Gateway and the Southern Extension. Bus lanes were included in this scenario as per the 2021 ‘do something’ scenario, along with an eastbound bus lane from west of Hume Highway at Ashfield to east of Sloane Street at Haberfield/Summer Hill, and a westbound bus lane from west of Norton Street at Leichhardt to Hume Highway at Ashfield (however, these bus lanes do not form part of the project).

### 8.1.2 Assess construction impacts

The construction impact assessment involved an assessment of anticipated
construction related vehicles travelling to, from, and within the project
footprint on the existing M4, Parramatta Road and local roads that would provide
access to construction ancillary facilities. Based on the construction program,
the fourth quarter of 2017 has been used as the assessment year for construction
impacts, as this is when peak construction traffic volumes are expected.

### 8.1.3 Assess operational impacts

LinSig traffic models were developed to determine the operational performance of
the existing and future road network during the AM and PM peak periods. The
modelling included interchanges with the project intersections along Parramatta
Road and the surrounding road network in the vicinity of the project.

Following the calibration of AM peak and PM peak base LinSig models, future year
networks and traffic demands were developed for the five key modelling scenarios
to be assessed:

* 2017 future year construction model
* 2021 and 2031 future year 'do minimum' models
* 2021 and 2031 future year 'do something' models.


The objective of the 'do minimum' models was to provide a benchmark to compare
the operational performance of the 'do something' scenarios against future
network conditions without the project and subsequent WestConnex stages.

The operational traffic assessment also included crash analysis, travel speeds
and travel time analysis, and opportunities to enhance public and active
transport networks within the project area.

### 8.2 Existing environment

#### 8.2.1 Route description

Figure 8.1 shows the road network in the vicinity of the project.

##### Parramatta Road

Parramatta Road is classified as a State Significant Road and forms a major
east–west Sydney metropolitan road corridor. The road extends from the
intersection of the M4 and Church Street at Granville in the west, to Broadway
on the south-western outskirts of the Sydney CBD in the east. It connects to
several other major east–west road corridors, including the M4.

The road varies between two and three lanes in each direction. In the eastbound
direction, two lanes are provided from Homebush Bay Drive to Bedford Road at
Homebush West, then three lanes to Knight Street at Homebush. Parramatta Road
then narrows to two lanes to Concord Road at North Strathfield/Concord, and then
widens to three lanes to Sloane Street at Haberfield. Continuing east, beyond
the project area, two lanes remain after Sloane Street up until immediately
after Flood Street at Leichhardt, where a bus lane is added.

In the westbound direction, two lanes are provided from Crystal Street at
Petersham to Norton Street at Leichhardt, where it widens to three lanes. The
road narrows to two lanes just after Liverpool Road (Hume Highway) at Ashfield,
and then widens to three lanes after Dalhousie Street at Haberfield, where it
continues as three lanes to the intersection with the existing M4. The approach
to the M4 consists of one through lane and two right-turn lanes to the M4
westbound, which extend back to Phillip Street at Strathfield. Continuing west,
the configuration increases to two lanes from Concord Road at North
Strathfield/Concord to George Street at North Strathfield, followed by three
lanes from George Street to Homebush Bay Drive.

Parramatta Road has a posted speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour in both
directions. There are 22 signalised intersections along the 9.6 kilometre long
section of the road between Centenary Drive/Homebush Bay Drive at Homebush and
Orpington Street at Ashfield.

In the vicinity of the project, Parramatta Road is of local and regional
importance. It provides the main route for road vehicles travelling to, from, or
through the corridor. The main Parramatta Road transport corridor accommodates a
mix of travel demand characteristics that range from short local trips to longer
through vehicle movements. The diverse types of business along the Parramatta
Road transport corridor service both the local and wider community, meaning that
a number of medium distance, one way trips are generated along the corridor.

  <img src="images/figure-8-1.png" alt="Map of Traffic study area" />
  <figcaption>
    Figure 8.1 Existing road network within the study area
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Adjacent transport corridors in the vicinity of the project, such as the Hume
Highway, Wattle Street, Concord Road and the M4, connect Parramatta Road to
major centres across the Sydney metropolitan area.

Parramatta Road currently accommodates high levels of demand to and from the M4,
but functions as an arterial roadway, generally favouring through movements.

##### M4 Motorway

The M4 extends between the Blue Mountains at its western end and Parramatta Road
at Concord at its eastern end. The M4 and Parramatta Road transport corridor is
the main road freight, commercial and passenger route between the Sydney CBD,
the inner-western suburbs, Parramatta, greater western Sydney and beyond to the
Blue Mountains.

The M4 varies from two to four lanes in each direction, with on-ramps merging
with the mainline carriageways in some locations resulting in operational
constraints. East of Homebush Bay Drive, the posted speed limit varies between
60 and 90 kilometres per hour in each direction.

Work on the M4 Widening project began in March 2015. This project involves
widening the M4 between Pitt Street at Parramatta and Homebush Bay Drive at
Homebush, to include generally four lanes in each direction. The M4 Widening
project also includes a new access from Hill Road to the M4 eastbound and a new
on-ramp southbound from Homebush Bay Drive to the M4 westbound.

##### East–west routes

Alternative east–west arterial roads located in the vicinity of the project
include:

* Frederick Street/Wattle Street/Dobroyd Parade/City West Link – this route, which is about 2.8 kilometres long, is a major connector between Sydney’s western and south-western suburbs and the Sydney CBD. It carries high volumes of traffic and provides an alternative route to Parramatta Road into Sydney CBD from inner-southern and inner-western Sydney
* Queens Road/Gipps Street/Patterson Street – this route extends about 3.4 kilometres from its intersection with Great North Road and Fairlight Street at Five Dock in the east, to Concord Road at Concord in the west. It provides an alternative route between Five Dock and Concord/M4 and serves a significant number of local businesses
* Hume Highway/Liverpool Road – this route, located to the south of Parramatta Road, is classified as a State Significant Road and provides an important metropolitan connection for both local and regional traffic. It extends from Liverpool in south-western Sydney, to join Parramatta Road near Summer Hill in the east, about 450 metres south-east of the project.

##### North–south routes

Key north–south arterial roads within the study area include:

* Homebush Bay Drive/Centenary Drive – this route extends about 6.5 kilometres between the northern Concord Road intersection at Rhodes and southern Hume Highway/Roberts Road intersection at Strathfield/Greenacre. It links the St George region, Sydney Olympic Park, Ryde, Sydney’s northern suburbs and the Northern Beaches. It includes east and west facing ramps to and from the M4.  There are four signalised intersections along this corridor
* Concord Road/Leicester Avenue – this route extends about five kilometres between the intersection with Church Street at Meadowbank and the intersection with Everton Road at Strathfield. The Homebush Bay Drive/Centenary Drive route connects to Concord Road in Rhodes. Therefore, both routes share a similar north–south connectivity function in terms of linking the St George region with Sydney’s northern suburbs. However, Concord Road intersects with Parramatta Road further to the east and provides access to Strathfield rather than to Sydney Olympic Park. East facing ramps on the northern side of Parramatta Road provide direct access to and from the M4
* Great North Road and Lyons Road – extends about four kilometres through Five Dock and Drummoyne. It provides a north–east connection between Parramatta Road and Victoria Road.

#### 8.2.2 Traffic volumes and patterns

To understand and analyse existing traffic volumes and patterns in the vicinity
of the project, traffic surveys were undertaken between 2012 and 2014. The
surveys recorded hourly traffic volumes at seven locations over a one week
survey period. Survey locations are shown in Figure 8.2.

The following volumes are shown in Table 8.2 for the seven survey sites:

* AM peak: morning single hour peak recorded between 6.00 am and 10.00 am
* PM peak: evening single hour peak recorded between 3.00 pm and 7.00 pm
* Average weekday traffic (AWT) volume: daily traffic volume – derived from 24 hour traffic counts recorded between Monday and Friday during the survey week
* Average daily traffic (ADT) volume: daily traffic volume – derived from 24 hour traffic counts recorded between Monday and Sunday during the survey week.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

The following key findings can be drawn from the traffic volumes shown in Table
8.2, and the figures in section 5.4 of the traffic and transport assessment in
Appendix G:

* Parramatta Road:
    * Two-way AWT ranges from 101,375 east of the M4 to 89,060 west of Wattle
    Street, which equates to a 12 per cent reduction in daily traffic along
    Parramatta Road between these two locations. Moreover, AWT decreases to 63,535
    vehicles per day on Parramatta Road at the Hawthorne Canal, which is a 37 per
    cent and 29 per cent reduction in comparison to the respective volumes east of
    the M4 and west of Wattle Street
    * AWT is generally around two per cent greater than ADT at all three locations
    on Parramatta Road, by direction and in combination. This indicates that average
    daily weekend traffic is generally at similar levels to ADT and hence the road
    corridor accommodates consistently high volumes of travel demand that are not
    biased towards weekday work-related trips
    * Peak period traffic volumes show similar trends to daily figures with the
    two-way AM peak and PM peak being 6,205 and 6,035 vehicles per hour respectively
    east of the M4. Importantly, the graphics show a fairly 'flat' profile of
    traffic throughout the day between the AM peak and PM peak periods at the three
    Parramatta Road locations. This confirms that traffic volumes on Parramatta Road
    are consistent throughout an average weekday, both during and between the more
    conventional morning and evening 'peak' periods
    * Traffic surveys recorded at three locations on Parramatta Road confirm that
    there is typically an even spread of directional volumes during the AM peak, PM
    peak and daily periods. The only location that shows a considerable deviation
    from this statistic is on Parramatta Road at the Hawthorne Canal during the AM
    peak, where eastbound volumes around 30 per cent higher than westbound traffic
* Dobroyd Parade:
    * Two-way AM peak and PM peak volumes recorded on Dobroyd Parade was 3,525 and
    3,940 vehicles per hour respectively. Interestingly, the highest hourly volume
    was 2,115 vehicles in the eastbound direction during the PM peak period, which
    suggests that more vehicles are travelling towards the Sydney CBD in the evening
    * The two-way AWT volume on Dobroyd Parade is slightly less than the equivalent
    ADT figure, which suggests that traffic levels are fairly consistent across the
    seven day period, in line with patterns on the connecting Parramatta Road
    corridor
* Queens Road:
    * Directional peak period traffic volumes on Queens Road are at similar levels,
    ranging from 960 to 1045 vehicles per hour in the respective eastbound direction
    and westbound direction; during the average PM peak hour. This trend continues
    throughout the day with directional and two-way AWT and ADT volumes at similar
    levels, which peak to 27,325 vehicles during an average weekday. The profile of
    traffic across an average weekday on shows a more predictable pattern for
    two-way volumes, with more defined peaks during the morning and evening peak
    periods.
* Ramsay Street:
    * Peak hour volumes recorded on Ramsay Street are similar by direction and
    time-period, with the maximum flow around 1,000 vehicles per hour. Two-way AWT
    and ADT volumes were 26,100 and 25,155 vehicles per day, which equates to a four
    per cent increase in daily traffic during the five day period.
* Hume Highway:
    * Peak period counts on the Hume Highway show higher volumes of traffic in the
    eastbound and westbound direction during the respective AM peak and PM peak
    period. This suggests that the majority of vehicles are travelling towards the
    CBD in the morning and from the CBD in the evening.

#### 8.2.3 Existing road network performance

##### Level of service

‘Level of service’ (LoS) is a measure to determine the operational conditions
and efficiency of a roadway or intersection. The six levels of service range
from A to F, with A representing the best operating conditions and F the worst.
It is generally the practice of NSW Roads and Maritime Services (Roads and
Maritime) to initiate investigations when the level of service of a roadway or
intersection falls to D, and provide suitable remediation prior to the level of
service decreasing further E or F. Further information on the definitions and
calculation of level of service is provided in section 6.1 of the traffic and
transport assessment (Appendix G).

##### Operational performance – roadways

Levels of service along the Parramatta Road and Wattle Street corridors under
existing conditions are provided in Table 8.3 for the AM and PM peak. The
Parramatta Road corridor currently experiences high levels of mid-block traffic
demand. West of Concord Road, the level of service generally exceeds D, with the
mid-block volumes often exceeding the theoretical capacity of the road. The
results indicate that, east of the M4, there are eastbound capacity issues
during the AM peak. This reflects the relatively low traffic volumes on
Parramatta Road west of Concord Road since the removal of tolls on the M4. An
exception is east of Bland Street, where the traffic volumes on Parramatta Road
are lower due to congestion at the Wattle Street intersection. High northbound
volumes are also evident on Dobroyd Parade, reflecting city bound demand in the
morning peak. The results for the PM peak are similar, although high traffic
volumes are recorded in both directions. Low westbound traffic east of Bland
Street can be explained by congestion at the Hume Highway intersection and the
extra lane on Parramatta Road west of Dalhousie Street.

The Gipps Street and Queens Road corridor also experiences high traffic volumes
and has a level of service of E/F in both peaks, with the exception of PM
eastbound west of Great North Road. The midblock level of service for the
existing M4 is generally D, but is somewhat distorted by queuing at the
Parramatta Road intersection which artificially limits throughput.

The Parramatta Road and Wattle Street corridors experience significant
congestion during the AM and PM peaks. The traffic signals are coordinated to
provide priority along the corridor to reduce the average delays to the major
through movements in the peak direction. The results shown in the table indicate
that a number of the intersections operate at or close to capacity.
Intersections with a number of conflicting movements experience higher average
intersection delays.
##### Traffic crash history

###### Parramatta Road

Between July 2009 and June 2014, 919 crashes were recorded on Parramatta Road
between Homebush Bay Drive and Balmain Road. Two were fatal crashes, 400
resulted in injury and 517 were non-casualty crashes. Of these crashes, 621 (68
per cent) occurred at intersections.

The crash breakdown indicates that about 43 per cent of crashes were rear end
crashes. This is consistent with roadways that are approaching capacity and
along which high levels of queuing occur on the approaches to intersections.
About 15 per cent of crashes were between opposing vehicles, and about 10 per
cent resulted from lane changes.

###### Corridor analysis

Crash severity indices provide an assessment of road safety based on the type
and number of crashes occurring. All crash types carry different weightings with
fatal crashes having the highest weighting. The crash severity index for
Parramatta Road is 1.22 which is equal to the average for the Sydney
Metropolitan Area. The M4 has a slightly lower rating of 1.18.

Existing tunnels in Sydney (eg Lane Cove, Eastern Distributor, Cross City Tunnel
and Sydney Harbour Tunnel) have a crash severity index of 1.16 which is
reflective of the more controlled conditions, lower speeds and greater drive
care when travelling in tunnels.

Table 8.5 outlines the average crash rates for Parramatta Road, M4 and existing
Sydney tunnels. Parramatta Road has a significantly higher crash rate compared
to the M4 and existing Sydney Tunnels. Crash rates within Sydney’s tunnels are
substantially lower than on the M4 Motorway (ie three times lower) and
Parramatta Road (ie about 12 times lower).

Crashes on Parramatta Road between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2014 cost an
estimated total of $62,395,968, or $12,479,194 per annum. The analysis indicates
an average crash cost per 100 million vehicle kilometres travelled of
$14,670,060 for the four sections analysed.

#### 8.2.4 Public and active transport

##### Bus network

The project falls within the Sydney Metropolitan Bus Region 6, which is operated
by Sydney Buses. The bus network in the vicinity of the project includes buses
servicing the Hurstville to Macquarie Park strategic north–south bus corridor
(route M41) and the Burwood to the CBD strategic east–west bus route (route
461), which runs along Parramatta Road. There are several bus routes that
operate within particular sections of the project area via train station hubs,
such as Strathfield, Burwood and Ashfield.

There are a number of bus services that travel along sections of Parramatta Road
between Homebush Bay Drive and Wattle Street (routes 525, 526, 461, 415, 490,
492 and 491). Six Sydney Metropolitan Bus Region 6 routes cross Parramatta Road
during peak periods between Homebush Bay Drive and Wattle Street.

Sydney’s Bus Future (Transport for NSW 2013) and the Parramatta Road Urban
Transformation Program (being undertaken by Urban Growth NSW in conjunction with
the project) will result in changes to the bus network using Parramatta Road and
the wider project area.

##### Rail network

The project area is serviced by the North Shore, Northern and Western Rail Line
(T1), and the Airport, Inner West and South Rail Line (T2). To the north of the
project, North Strathfield Station is serviced by the Main Northern Rail Line
which provides limited stops services to Sydney Central. To the south, up to 10
stations are serviced by the T1 and/or T2 Lines with some stations supporting
limited stop express services. Strathfield and Burwood stations (to the south)
accommodate the highest volume of passengers due to the large number of AM and
PM peak services.

##### Pedestrian network

The nature of the pedestrian network in the vicinity of the project varies.
Residential areas generally provide good local walking connections and
footpaths, particularly in areas away from major roads. Sydney Markets, Sydney
Olympic Park, Rhodes and Burwood are close to the study area and within walking
distance to rail station and bus connections.

There are a limited number of signalised pedestrian crossings on Parramatta
Road. The distance between signalised pedestrian crossings is up to 800 metres
in some sections.

##### Cycling network

There are limited segregated cycling facilities along the Parramatta Road
corridor. Dedicated cycleways or cycle lanes are generally aimed towards leisure
rather than commuter trips. There are major gaps in north–south connections, due
to the lack of permeability of Parramatta Road and the M4. In the project area,
cyclists currently use the shoulders of the existing M4 to travel both eastbound
and westbound. In the eastbound direction, cyclists are required to leave the M4
at Sydney Street due to the inadequate shoulder east of Sydney Street. In the
westbound direction, cyclists access the M4 from the westbound on-ramp at
Concord Road, due to the inadequate shoulder east of this location.

### 8.3 Assessment of construction impacts

Construction of the project has the potential to result in changes and
disruptions to the existing road and transport network as a result of:

* The movement of construction vehicles, particularly heavy vehicles
transporting spoil, to and from the construction footprint, including the 10
construction ancillary facilities

* Surface works requiring temporary traffic, cyclist and/or pedestrian
diversions, road occupation, alterations to access, alterations to bus stops,
temporary road closures, and alterations to speed limits.

A summary of the construction impact assessment is provided in the following
sections.

#### 8.3.1 Construction traffic volumes and routes

##### Type of traffic generated by construction

Construction would result in the generation of additional movements of both
heavy and light vehicles on the road network. Construction traffic was divided
into three categories for assessment purposes:

* Removal of spoil generated by construction activities
* Heavy vehicle deliveries and other heavy vehicles associated with construction activities
* Light vehicles travelling to and from ancillary construction facilities.

The impacts of the project during construction were assessed assuming that spoil
would be hauled in a westerly direction along the M4.

The majority of the ancillary construction facilities proposed for the project
would have some parking available, however parking would not be provided for the
whole construction workforce. The management of construction workforce parking
is discussed further in section 6.6.5 of Chapter 6 (Construction work). An
upgraded car park on the northern side of Concord Oval would provide about 250
car parking spaces for employees of the main project office during weekdays
(before 6.30 pm). During weekends and after 6.30 pm on weekdays, the following
indicative allocation of car spaces would occur:


* 145 public parking spaces on Saturdays (leaving 100 for the construction workforce)
* 195 public parking spaces on Sundays (leaving 50 for the construction workforce)
* 145 public parking spaces on weeknights after 6.30 pm (leaving 100 for the construction workforce).

In addition, an existing car park at Railway Lane at North Strathfield
containing about 50 car parking spaces would be used. This site is within
walking distance of the Underwood Road civil and tunnel site (C3), Powells Creek
civil site (C4), and the Concord Road civil and tunnel site (C5).

##### Construction traffic volumes

Table 6.20 in Chapter 6 (Construction work) shows the predicted construction
traffic volumes for each ancillary construction facility during a typical AM
peak, PM peak and daily period. The table shows that the highest volumes of
heavy vehicles are forecast to originate from the Concord Road civil and tunnel
site (C5) and Northcote Street tunnel site (C7), with the highest volumes of
light vehicles generated by the Cintra Park tunnel site (C6).

Table 8.6 provides indicative volumes on key roads during the AM and PM peak
periods for construction heavy vehicles. The volumes shown are based on spoil
haulage occurring between 7,00 am and 10.00 pm daily. However, 24 hour spoil
haulage would be required during tunnelling activity.

      <th>M4 Motorway</th>
      <td>240</td>
      <td>203</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##### Construction traffic routes

Table 6.19 in Chapter 6 (Construction work) outlines the proposed access and
egress points to and from the construction ancillary facilities. The spoil
haulage routes from the tunnel sites are shown in Figure 6.22 to Figure 6.24 in
Chapter 6 (Construction work).

It has been assumed that concrete for tunnel construction would mainly originate
from batching plants close to the project, although other sources may also be
required. Other materials required for construction would, where as far as
practicable, originate from within the Sydney region. Vehicles would generally
use the arterial road network to access the various construction ancillary
facilities.

#### 8.3.2 Local road network impacts

Table 8.7 outlines the potential impacts of construction on the local road
network in the vicinity of each of the construction ancillary facilities.

#### 8.3.3 Road and intersection performance

##### Road performance during construction

Table 8.8 shows the impact of construction on the operation of key roads. The
table shows that several sections of Parramatta Road are forecast to exceed the
roadway capacity with the increased background traffic and construction traffic
in the 2017 AM and PM peak hours. The existing traffic volumes on these road
sections are congested.

##### Intersection level of service

The performance of key intersections in the vicinity of the project was modelled
for the intersections that would be likely to experience the highest traffic
volumes of construction traffic. The detailed results of modelling are provided
in section 7.4.3 of the Traffic and Transport Report in Appendix G. A summary of
these results is provided below.

The results indicate that for the 2017 ‘do minimum’ scenario, a number of key
intersections on the Parramatta Road corridor would operate at or above capacity
and experience high levels of delay during the AM and PM peak periods. The
following intersections would operate at a level of service F for this scenario:

* Patterson Street/Concord Road (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Concord Road (PM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Wentworth Road (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Burwood Road (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Frederick Street (AM and PM peak)
* Wattle Street/Ramsay Street (AM peak).

As each of these intersections already operates at capacity without construction
vehicles, the intersections are susceptible to large increases in average delay
with only small increases in demand as a result of construction traffic.
Background traffic growth accounts for part of the deterioration of the road
network. In addition to those intersections already forecast to operate at or
beyond capacity (without construction traffic), the modelling results indicate
that the performance of the following intersections would deteriorate to a LoS F:

* Parramatta Road/George Street (PM peak)
* Sydney Street/Concord Road (PM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Concord Road (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/M4 Motorway (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Broughton Street (AM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Croydon Road (AM and PM peak)
* Parramatta Road/Shaftsbury Road (AM peak).

The above results represent a worst case cumulative effect of construction
traffic. This would not occur for the entire duration of the construction
period.

It is noted that at some intersections, stable or minor improvements in
performance (with the addition of construction traffic) would occur as a result
of upstream intersections operating over capacity. Once capacity is reached,
upstream intersections behave as bottlenecks, reducing traffic flow to
downstream intersections. This explains why some intersections show slight
improvements to performance with the addition of construction traffic.

#### 8.3.4 Access changes

Table 6.16 in Chapter 6 (Construction work) shows the temporary road closures
and diversions on the existing road network required to facilitate construction.
The majority of road and lane closures are anticipated to result in limited
impacts to road users, as they would mainly affect local roads with low traffic
volumes and/or streets where land acquisition is taking place. Alternative
routes could therefore be used with minimal impacts.

Traffic lanes would be maintained on Sydney Street during peak hours. Impacts on
the Sydney Street/Concord Road intersection as a result of construction traffic
and changes to signal phasing are considered in section 8.3.3.
Existing lanes would generally be maintained on Ramsay Street although some
short term detours, lane closures and temporary diversions may occur where
approved under a Traffic Management and Safety Plan.

It is predicted that the inclusion of new signals at Parramatta Road and
Orpington Street would only impact westbound vehicles. Potential impacts would
be limited as a result of the low construction vehicle volumes, which would mean
the turning signal would only be used infrequently. Impacts would also reduce if
the signal phasing is offset with the Dalhousie Street intersection.

Parking restrictions would be put in place on Underwood Road (at the Underwood
Road civil and tunnel site (C3)), and potentially at the Powell Street
intersection to accommodate movements to the Powells Creek civil site (C4) via
Powell Street.

#### 8.3.5 Road safety

Construction traffic volumes are expected to be relatively low compared to
existing traffic volumes on Parramatta Road and the M4. As a worst-case
scenario, around 2,000 vehicles per day would be generated by construction, with
heavy vehicles comprising slightly more than half this total. Compared to
existing traffic volumes, construction traffic would be the equivalent of around
two per cent of total daily traffic on Parramatta Road in the study area.

As the volume of traffic generated by construction is expected to be relatively
low compared to existing traffic volumes, the impacts of this short-term
increase in traffic on the existing road network is not expected to
significantly impact road safety in the vicinity of the project. In addition,
any foreseen impacts to road safety during construction would be mitigated
through the provision of tailored traffic management plans and other measures.

#### 8.3.6 Public transport

##### Bus network

An increase in heavy vehicles on the existing road network during the
construction period would be likely to result in increased delays at
intersections along the project corridor and in surrounding areas. It is likely
that the volumes of heavy vehicles on Parramatta Road and surrounding major
roads would increase. Construction would have the potential to result in the
following impacts to public transport services:

* An increase in bus service travel times due to slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays
* Longer travel times to and from bus stops by supplementary travel modes (eg car passenger, walking to/from bus stop) due to an increase in traffic volumes, slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays
* Reduced amenity for bus users waiting at stops
* At least four bus-stops would need to be relocated to protect community safety during construction
* Connections between bus services and trains services may be affected.

Table 6.18 in Chapter 6 (Construction work) outlines the indicative changes to
bus stop locations during construction. These would be subject to consultation
with Transport for NSW.

##### Rail network

No impacts to rail services in the project corridor and surrounding areas are
expected as a result of construction. Bus service connections to railway
stations may be affected due to a potential reduction in the reliability of bus
services during construction.

#### 8.3.7 Pedestrians and cyclists

Pedestrian and cyclist diversions required during construction are outlined in
Table 6.17 in Chapter 6 (Construction work).

The increase in heavy vehicle volumes during construction would potentially
impact walking and cycling as follows:

* Walking:
    * Increased walking distance as a result of diversions and road closures in some locations
    * Reduced pedestrian amenity
    * Potential adverse effect on pedestrian wait times at signalised intersections if adjustments are made to accommodate increased volumes
* Cycling:
    * Increased delays at intersections for on road cyclists due to an increase in traffic volumes
    * Increase in journey time and distance due to closed shoulders and detours
    * Reduced cyclist amenity.

A staging plan would be implemented to ensure connectivity is maintained for
cyclists during construction. This would involve the provision of detour routes
as the section of existing cycle route on the M4, around Homebush Bay Drive,
would be unavailable during construction. A diversion route, to remove cyclists
off the M4 has been implemented for the M4 Widening project, and this detour may
be used during construction of the M4 East project. To avoid Concord Road, a
further diversion would be provided (refer to section 6.6.2 and Figure 6.19 in
Chapter 6 (Construction work)). The route would be confirmed following
appropriate consultation with Roads and Maritime, local councils and cycling
groups.

### 8.4 Assessment of operation impacts

#### 8.4.1 Road and intersection performance

##### Road performance during operation

The midblock level of service at key locations in the vicinity of the project
was assessed for both the ‘do minimum’ and 'do something' scenarios. The results
of modelling the 2021 and 2031 AM peak and PM peak operational performance of
the project (the ‘do something’ scenarios) are summarised in Table 8.9 to Table
8.12. The results for the ‘do minimum’ scenarios are provided for comparison.

There will be a reduction in traffic volumes on some sections of Parramatta Road
as a result of the project which provides an opportunity to improve public
transport along the corridor (not included as part of this project). The results
of the 2021 AM peak and PM peak indicate that level of service along Parramatta
Road improves significantly between the M4 and Dalhousie Street, with small
deteriorations elsewhere. This reflects the extent of the project, and the fact
that a larger number of vehicles can access Parramatta Road east of the project
due to the increased capacity provided. It is noted that some of the higher
traffic densities are observed downstream of the project on- and off- ramps on
Parramatta Road and Wattle Street. This provides an indication of the extra
capacity provided to take vehicles to those locations, and of potential exit and
merge issues. A high level of service is provided within the section of the
project carrying the most vehicles, east of Concord Road.
