# WestConnex M4 East Environmental Impact Statement

## 8. Traffic and transport

This chapter outlines the potential traffic and transport impacts associated with the M4 East project (the project). A detailed traffic and transport assessment has been undertaken for the project and is included in Appendix G.

The Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment has issued a set of environmental assessment requirements for the project; these are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 8.1 sets out these requirements as they relate to traffic and transport, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).
